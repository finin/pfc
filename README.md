# Pfc -- forward chaining in Prolog

The Pfc system is a package that provides a forward reasoning capability to be used together with conventional Prolog programs.  The Pfc inference rules are Prolog terms which are asserted as clauses into the regular Prolog database.  When new facts or forward reasoning rules are added to the Prolog database (via a special predicate add/1, forward reasoning is triggered and additional facts that can be deduced via the application of the forward chaining rules are also added to the database.  A simple justification-based truth-maintenance system is provided as well as predicates to explore the resulting proof trees.
